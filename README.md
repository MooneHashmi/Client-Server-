The primary purpose of Stage 1 was to design and implement a plain/vanilla version of a Client-side simulator that acts as a simple job dispatcher. My client (client-side simulator) will communicate with the ds-server and schedule jobs to the ds-server using a specific algorithm called Largest Round Robin(LRR).

The project is divided into two stages:

Stage 1 - Design and implement a vanilla client-side simulator that contains basic scheduling functions and a simple job dispatcher. A demo of the client connecting to the server will be included as well as a five page report documenting:

System Overview
Design
Implementation

Stage 2 - Design and implement new scheduling algorithms that will be compared to other algorithms such as First-Fit (FF), Best-Fit (BF) and Worst-Fit (WF).
